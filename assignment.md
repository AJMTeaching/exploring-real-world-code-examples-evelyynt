# Assignment: Exploring Real-World Code Examples
## Introduction
In our everyday lives, we interact with a myriad of software applications, often without realizing the complex code that powers them. From the moment we silence our morning alarm, to checking the weather forecast, or even making an online purchase, software is an integral part of our daily routine. As we embark on our journey to learn coding, it's essential to understand how these applications are built and function. This assignment, designed for beginners, leverages our newly acquired skills in using GitHub and other online repositories. It's an opportunity to explore and connect with the real-world applications of code.

## Objective
Your task is to delve into the world of coding by finding real-life examples of code that power the software applications you use daily. This exercise will help you understand how theoretical coding concepts are applied in practical, real-world scenarios.

## Assignment Details
Research and Exploration: Using online repositories like GitHub, search for code examples that align with the everyday software applications described in the provided prose blurbs.

Link and Line Numbers: For each example, provide the link to the code repository and specify the exact line numbers where the relevant code is located. This will help you practice navigating through code repositories and understanding code structure.

Documentation: Along with each link, write a brief description of what the code does and how it relates to the functionality of the application in the real world.

## Prose Blurbs for Exploration
- Code that specifies when an alarm clock should start making audible sounds.
- Code for a rocket targeting system.
- File compression utility algorithm.
- Weather forecasting algorithm.
- E-commerce checkout system process.
- Social media post scheduler.
- Fitness app calorie counter.
- Online voting system mechanics.
- Automated email response system.

## Submission Format

Document Title: "Exploring Code in Daily Life"
Content Structure: For each of the nine blurbs, include a heading with the blurb title, followed by your findings (link and line numbers) and a brief description. Also, do the same for 3 kinds of tools you use every day (for example: how the email app knows there are new messages, how my calendar adds new items, how my video game authenticates my user/password)
Length: No more than two paragraphs per blurb.
Evaluation Criteria
Accuracy: Correctly identifying relevant sections of code.
Clarity: Clear and concise descriptions of how the code functions.
Research Skills: Ability to effectively use online resources like GitHub.
